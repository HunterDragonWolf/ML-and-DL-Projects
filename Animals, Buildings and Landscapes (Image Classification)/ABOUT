It has been very easy for all the bginers and ametuers to find classification models and their toturials
online over the browsers or through youtube. I personally found it a little different to classify using not 2
(which is pretty basic and readily available) but 3 classes. The images of animals, buildings and landscapes were taken on random,
and the classification model using the RNN ideology was able to precisely and accurately (to maximum logical extent) classify the classes.
