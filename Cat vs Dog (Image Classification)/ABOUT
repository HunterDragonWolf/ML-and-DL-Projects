The project "Password Generator", is a very handy python project which helps in providing passwords.
In simpler words, the program basically provides with a password of various lengths with various combinations between upper case and lower case alphabets,
combined with special characters and numeric values.

The project is very basic but the fact that the passwords generated are so random and unpredictable,
is what gives a slight cutting edge advantage over many situations.
